## Human years to Dog years
This is a simple algorithm that shows how many year you would have if you were a dog, it can be run on any javascript intepreter like nodejs.

The formula works like this:
- The first 2 years of a dog equals to 10.5 human years
- The rest are 4 human years per each dog year

```
d = (h-10.5)/4 + 2;
```
Where d = dog years, h = human years and this only applies for human years above 10.5
